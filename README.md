# Böker Prime Mod

The Böker Prime is a very nice short bladed and heavy duty working knife. But nothing's perfect: the handle is a bit short for my fit, the paracord wrap is definetly not to my taste and the sheath is pretty unusable.

So these are my modifications:
* The scales make the handle longer and wider
* The sheath is inspired by the popular Mora/Hultafors working knives. Nothing fancy, simple and functional
